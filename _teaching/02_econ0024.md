The course aims to provide final year students with the opportunity to explore the way in which economic theory and evidence can be used to analyse topical policy issues.

At the end of the course, students should:
* Have an understanding of the application of economic theory and empirical methods to issues in current economic policy analysis.
    
* Have had the experience of analysing a complex and unfamiliar issues, drawing on their knowledge of economic theory and methods, and on a range of relevant research and policy papers, without being able to rely on comprehensive textbook treatments.

* Be able to write cogent and well-argued analyses of a number of aspects of the issues they have studied, making appropriate use of both theory and empirical evidence.
