Task 1: Exploring the Current State of the UK Economy
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Learn how to assess the health of the UK macroeconomy using key indicators.

Instructions:
- Identify and collect recent data on the following UK macroeconomic indicators (e.g. from ONS, Bank of England, OECD, or UK government statistical websites):
  - GDP growth (current and historical)
  - Interest rates (Bank of England base rate)
  - Inflation rate (CPI or RPI)
  - Employment and unemployment rates

- For each series:
  1. Find recent values and trends (e.g. last 5 years).
  2. Plot or tabulate the data.
  3. Evaluate what each indicator reveals about UK economic performance.
     - Is GDP growing strongly or stagnating?
     - Are inflation and wages keeping pace?
     - Are interest rates high or low, and what does that imply?
     - Is employment high (low unemployment), and who is working?

- Reflect on the context:
  - What could be causing recent economic changes?
  - Write your findings and reflections below:

Task 2: Why Labour Economics Matters
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Understand the big-picture relevance of labour economics and link macro performance to workers.

Before we dive into the data, let’s take a step back and think about some bigger questions.

What is labour economics?
Labour economics is the study of how people work, how much they earn, and how jobs are created or lost. It’s about understanding:
- How wages are determined
- Why some jobs pay more than others
- Who gets employed and who doesn’t
- What governments can do to improve outcomes for workers

Why is it important?
Workers are at the heart of the economy — they are both producers and consumers:

- As producers: Workers supply their time and skills to help produce goods and services. They are part of the “labour” input in the economy’s aggregate supply.
- As consumers: Workers use their wages to buy goods and services. This spending drives aggregate demand. When wages rise, demand can increase — but so can costs for businesses.
- As citizens: Workers pay taxes, vote, and are directly affected by public policy. Understanding their experiences helps us think about fairness, inequality, and social mobility.

Reflection Questions:
1. Why do you think economists study work and wages so closely?
2. What happens to the economy if wages fall for a large group of people? What about if lots of people lose their jobs?
3. Think about your own future. What would you want from the labour market? A good job? Fair pay? Job security?
4. Can you think of any recent news stories where work or wages were central issues (e.g. strikes, cost of living, AI replacing jobs)? What economic questions do they raise?
5. How do changes in the supply and demand for labour influence aggregate demand and aggregate supply in the economy?

Task 3: Introduction to the pseudo data
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Understand how economists use data to answer real-world questions.

Instructions:
You will be introduced to a dataset that reflects what economists would typically find in a Labour Force Survey (LFS). This dataset contains information on earnings, hours worked, education, age, and other characteristics of workers in the UK.

Take some time to explore the dataset.
- What are the key variables?
- Can you find information on:
  - Weekly or annual earnings?
  - Age and gender?
  - Education level?

--------------------------------------------
Task 4: What Does the Average Worker Earn?
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Reflect on average earnings and what they represent.

Instructions:
Look up the average annual earnings in the dataset.

Now reflect:
a) What does this number mean? What does it capture and what might it miss?
b) Would you be happy living on that income? Why or why not?
c) Is this a useful benchmark for thinking about your future career? Explain.

Your Responses:
[Write here]


--------------------------------------------
Task 5: What Influences How Much People Earn?
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Develop hypotheses about the factors that affect earnings.

Instructions:
a) Make a list of characteristics you think influence how much people earn.
b) For each factor, write a short note on why it might matter.
c) Think about how to test your ideas. What graphs or tables could you make?

Your Hypotheses & Ideas:

--------------------------------------------
Task 6: Test Your Ideas in the Data
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Explore relationships in the data.

Instructions:
Using charts or tables, examine how earnings vary by:
- Age
- Education
- Gender
- Hours worked

What patterns do you observe?
Were your predictions correct?
How might you explain what you see?

Your Observations:
[Write here]


--------------------------------------------
Task 7: Why Are You Going to University?
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Link personal choices to economic models of decision-making.

Instructions:
a) Think carefully about your decision to attend university. What motivated it? What did you give up?
b) Economists talk about “constrained decision making”. What constraints (financial, personal, social) shaped your choice?
c) How important was future earnings in your thinking?

Reflection:
[Write here]


--------------------------------------------
Task 8: Returns to Education
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Understand how economists estimate the financial value of education.

Instructions:
a) Use the data to compare average earnings of people with and without university degrees.
b) Is this a fair comparison? What other factors might influence the difference?
c) How might we improve the comparison (e.g., control for age, hours, region)?

Analysis:
[Write here]


--------------------------------------------
Task 9: Inequality in Earnings
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Visualize and reflect on earnings inequality.

Instructions:
a) How could we measure inequality? (e.g., percentiles, Gini coefficient)
b) Create a chart (such as a histogram or Lorenz curve) to show the spread of earnings.
c) Reflect:
   - What do you notice?
   - Is inequality fair?
   - Should those who invest in education be rewarded?
d) What could governments do to reduce inequality? What tools do they have?

--------------------------------------------
Task 10: What Is the Minimum Wage?
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Learn how minimum wages are set and why they matter.

Instructions:
a) Research how the UK minimum wage has changed over the last 15 years. Make a timeline or graph.
b) What is the current level? How many people does it affect?
c) Why might governments raise the minimum wage?

Summary:

--------------------------------------------
Task 11: Who Earns the Minimum Wage?
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Use data to understand which workers are affected.

Instructions:
a) Use the data to identify minimum wage earners.
b) Describe their characteristics:
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Education
   - Job type (industry, occupation)

Profile of Minimum Wage Workers:
[Write here]


--------------------------------------------
Task 12: Effects of the Minimum Wage
--------------------------------------------
Objective: Examine economic consequences of the policy.

Instructions:
a) Think like an economist. How would:
   - A firm respond to a higher minimum wage?
   - A worker respond?
b) Look at earnings before and after a known minimum wage increase. Did earnings rise?
c) What else might firms adjust (besides wages)? Think about hours, hiring, prices.

--------------------------------------------
Objective: Reflect on what you've learned and communicate your findings.

Instructions:
Prepare a short summary or presentation:
- What was your research question?
- What did the data show?
- What surprised you?
- What would you explore next?

Use slides, a written report, or a short verbal summary.
